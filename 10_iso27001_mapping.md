# Mapping CIS Compliance to ISO/IEC 27001 (High-level)

CIS supports secure configuration and operational control effectiveness.

Examples:
- Secure configuration baselines → supports technical control implementation
- Logging and monitoring settings → supports detection/monitoring controls
- Access control hardening → supports access management controls

Use this mapping as a narrative bridge for audits and governance reporting.
