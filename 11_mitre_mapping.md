# Mapping Controls to MITRE ATT&CK (Defensive Coverage)

MITRE ATT&CK describes attacker techniques. CIS-style controls help **reduce** the likelihood
or **increase detection** of those techniques.

Examples (high level):
- Strong authentication / MFA → reduces credential abuse (e.g., brute force)
- Logging and auditing → improves detection of suspicious authentication and privilege use
- Least privilege / admin restrictions → reduces privilege escalation impact
- Network segmentation/firewalling → limits lateral movement

Tip: In interviews, say: “tools don’t map to ATT&CK directly; they support detection/prevention of techniques.”
