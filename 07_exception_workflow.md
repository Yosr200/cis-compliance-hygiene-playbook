# Exception (Risk Acceptance) Workflow

When remediation is not feasible immediately, use a controlled exception process.

## Requirements
- Clear description of the deviation
- Business rationale for exception
- Compensating controls (if any)
- Approval level (manager / CISO delegate)
- Review date (e.g., 90/180 days)
- Evidence of decision stored in an exceptions register
