# CIS Compliance & Cyber Hygiene Playbook

A practical, execution-focused project that explains how to run **CIS Benchmark compliance** in an enterprise:
from discovery → validation → remediation tracking → verification → audit evidence.

This repo is designed for **GRC / Cyber Hygiene / Compliance Ops** roles (e.g., CIS hardening compliance specialist).
It is **tool-agnostic** but includes **Qualys-style** workflow examples at a high level (no configuration guides).

## What you'll find
- CIS compliance lifecycle (end-to-end)
- How to validate findings and reduce false positives
- Prioritization model for CIS deviations
- Remediation tracking + exception (risk acceptance) workflow
- Audit-ready evidence pack checklist
- Metrics & KPIs (coverage, aging, SLA adherence)
- Mapping to ISO 27001 and MITRE ATT&CK (defensive coverage)
